Retrofit.Net
============
Retrofit.Net turns your Rest API into a C# interface


Acknowledgements
============
This library is heavily inspired by Retrofit ( https://github.com/square/retrofit )... I even stole the name!

RestSharp is used to do all the heavy lifting - this is essentially a Retrofit-style wrapper for Rest#.
